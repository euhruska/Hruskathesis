\chapter*{Acknowledgments}


This dissertation is just the final product of a long path, starting when I joined Rice University in 2014.
Along this long path, I have received lots of help and lots of advice. Here I want to thank everyone even though 
I can only mention some.

At the center of this path is Cecilia Clementi. As my advisor, she guided me through the ups and downs, helping me understand why something did and did not work. This has helped me grow professionally
and personally.
She consistently encouraged me to improve my results and persist when software bugs caused bad results. Without her, this work would not have been possible; she has been an incredible advisor. 

All my previous and current lab mates played a significant role in helping me along this path. Jordane and Lorenzo helped me from the start to learn the crucial as well the less obvious skills for this path. Many thanks to Shantenu, Vivek, and Jayvee for being great collaborators and for being always willing to help, whatever the question.

I would also like to thank Jose Onuchic, Jason Hafner, and Matteo Pasquali for agreeing to sit on my PhD defense committee.

Last but not least, I want to thank my family for the unconditional support. Thank you.

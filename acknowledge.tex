\chapter*{Acknowledgments}


This dissertation is just the final product of a long path, starting when I joined Rice University in 2014.
Along this long path I have received lot's of help, lot's of advice. Here I want to thank everyone even though 
I can only mention a some.

At the center of this path is Cecilia. As my advisor she guided me through the ups and downs, helping my understand what did and didn't work. 
She consistently encouraged me to improve my results and persist when some software bugs caused bad results. Without her this work wouldn't have been possible, she has been an incredible advisor. 

All my previous and current lab mates played a significant role in helping me along this path. Jordane and Lorenzo helped me from the start to learn the crucial and less obvious skills for this path. Many thanks to Shantenu, Vivek and Jayvee for being great collaborators and for being always been willing to help, whatever the question.


I would also like to thank Jose, Jason and Matteo for agreeing to sitting on my PhD defense
committee.

Last but not least I want to thank for the unconditional support of my family, which has helped me grow professionally
and personally. Thank you.

Ever increasing demand for high data rate wireless transmissions with high spectral efficiency leads to utilization of communication systems with multiple transmit and receive antennas. Excellent quality of service represented with near-channel capacity error-rate performance can be achieved with iterative receiver structure composed of inner soft detection and outer soft-input soft-output decoding. Emerging wireless 

\section{x}
\label{sec:x45}
Excellent error-rate performance in MIMO environment are made possible by employing sophisticated algorithms such as maximum \emph{a posteriori}~(MAP) detection techniques and outer channel decoding that provides error-correction in the presence of multiple access interference, burst channel fading, channel multi-paths, additive receiver noise, etc. An approximation of impractically complex optimal joint detection/decoding is achieved by iteratively improving the \emph{a posteriori} probabilities (APPs) of transmitted coded

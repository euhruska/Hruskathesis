  abstract = {Simulations of biological macromolecules play an important role in understanding the physical basis of a number of complex processes such as protein folding. Even with increasing computational power and evolution of specialized architectures, the ability to simulate protein folding at atomistic scales still remains challenging. This stems from the dual aspects of high dimensionality of protein conformational landscapes, and the inability of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to sufficiently sample these landscapes to observe folding events. Machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) techniques, when combined with atomistic MD simulations offer the opportunity to potentially overcome these limitations by: (1) effectively reducing the dimensionality of MD simulations to automatically build latent representations that correspond to biophysically relevant reaction coordinates (RCs), and (2) driving MD simulations to automatically sample potentially novel conformational states based on these RCs. We examine how coupling DL approaches with MD simulations can fold small proteins effectively on supercomputers. In particular, we study the computational costs and effectiveness of scaling DL-coupled MD workflows by folding two prototypical systems, viz., Fs-peptide and the fast-folding variant of the villin head piece protein. We demonstrate that a DL driven MD workflow is able to effectively learn latent representations and drive adaptive simulations. Compared to traditional MD-based approaches, our approach achieves an effective performance gain in sampling the folded states by at least 2.3x. Our study provides a quantitative basis to understand how DL driven MD simulations, can lead to effective performance gains and reduced times to solution on supercomputing resources.},

  abstract = {Nontargeted parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (nt-PaCS-MD) is proposed as an efficient conformational sampling method to enhance the conformational transitions of proteins, which is an extension of the original targeted PaCS-MD (t-PaCS-MD). The original PaCS-MD comprises cycles of (i) selection of initial structures for multiple independent MD simulations toward a predetermined target and (ii) conformational sampling by the independent MDs. In nt-PaCS-MD, structures that significantly deviate from an average are regarded as candidates that have high potential to address other metastable states and are chosen as the initial structures in the selection. To select significantly deviated structures, we examine the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of snapshots generated from the average structure based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. nt-PaCS-MD was applied to the folding of the mini-protein chignolin in implicit solvent and to the open-closed conformational transitions of T4 lysozyme (T4L) and glutamine binding protein (QBP) in explicit solvent. We show that nt-PaCS-MD can reach chignolin's native state and can also cause the open-closed transition of T4L and QBP on a nanosecond time scale, which are very efficient in terms of conformational sampling and comparable to that with t-PaCS-MD.},

  abstract = {Structural Dissimilarity Sampling (SDS) is proposed as an efficient conformational search method to promote structural transitions essential for the biological functions of proteins. In SDS, initial structures are selected based on structural dissimilarity, and conformational resampling is repeated. Conformational resampling is performed as follows: (I) arrangement of initial structures for a diverse distribution at the edge of a conformational subspace and (II) promotion of the structural transitions with multiple shorttime molecular dynamics (MD) simulations restarting from the diversely distributed initial structures. Cycles of (I) and (II) are repeated to intensively promote structural transitions because conformational resampling from the initial structures would quickly expand conformational distributions toward unvisited conformational subspaces. As a demonstration, SDS was first applied to maltodextrin binding protein (MBP) in explicit water to reproduce structural transitions between the open and closed states of MBP. Structural transitions of MBP were successfully reproduced with SDS in nanosecond-order simulation times. Starting from both the open and closed forms, SDS successfully reproduced the structural transitions within 25 cycles (a total of 250 ns of simulation time). For reference, a conventional long-time (500 ns) MD simulation under NPT (300 K and 1 bar) starting from the open form failed to reproduce the structural transition. In addition to the open-closed motions of MBP, SDS was applied to folding processes of the fast-folding proteins (chignolin, Trp-cage, and villin) and successfully sampled their native states. To confirm how the selections of initial structures affected conformational sampling efficiency, numbers of base sets for characterizing structural dissimilarity of initial structures were addressed in distinct trials of SDS. The parameter searches showed that the conformational sampling efficiency was relatively insensitive with respect to the numbers of base sets, indicating the robustness of SDS for actual applications.},

  abstract = {CoCo (``complementary coordinates'') is a method for ensemble enrichment based on principal component analysis (PCA) that was developed originally for the investigation of NMR data. Here we investigate the potential of the CoCo method, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations (CoCo-MD), to be used more generally for the enhanced sampling of conformational space. Using the alanine penta-peptide as a model system, we find that an iterative workflow, interleaving short multiple-walker MD simulations with long-range jumps through conformational space informed by CoCo analysis, can increase the rate of sampling of conformational space up to 10 times for the same computational effort (total number of MD timesteps). Combined with the reservoir-REMD method, free energies can be readily calculated. An alternative, approximate but fast and practically useful, alternative approach to unbiasing CoCo-MD generated data is also described. Applied to cyclosporine A, we can achieve far greater conformational sampling than has been reported previously, using a fraction of the computational resource. Simulations of the maltose binding protein, begun from the ``open'' state, effectively sample the ``closed'' conformation associated with ligand binding. The PCA-based approach means that optimal collective variables to enhance sampling need not be defined in advance by the user but are identified automatically and are adaptive, responding to the characteristics of the developing ensemble. In addition, the approach does not require any adaptations to the associated MD code and is compatible with any conventional MD package.},

  abstract = {The success of enhanced sampling molecular simulations that accelerate along collective variables (CVs) is predicated on the availability of variables coincident with the slow collective motions governing the long-time conformational dynamics of a system. It is challenging to intuit these slow CVs for all but the simplest molecular systems, and their data-driven discovery directly from molecular simulation trajectories has been a central focus of the molecular simulation community to both unveil the important physical mechanisms and drive enhanced sampling. In this work, we introduce state-free reversible VAMPnets (SRV) as a deep learning architecture that learns nonlinear CV approximants to the leading slow eigenfunctions of the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator that evolves equilibrium-scaled probability distributions through time. Orthogonality of the learned CVs is naturally imposed within network training without added regularization. The CVs are inherently explicit and differentiable functions of the input coordinates making them well-suited to use in enhanced sampling calculations. We demonstrate the utility of SRVs in capturing parsimonious nonlinear representations of complex system dynamics in applications to 1D and 2D toy systems where the true eigenfunctions are exactly calculable and to molecular dynamics simulations of alanine dipeptide and the WW domain protein.},

  abstract = {Exascale computing holds great opportunities for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, to take full advantage of the new possibilities, we must learn how to focus computational power on the discovery of complex molecular mechanisms, and how to extract them from enormous amounts of data. Both aspects still rely heavily on human experts, which becomes a serious bottleneck when a large number of parallel simulations have to be orchestrated to take full advantage of the available computing power. Here, we use artificial intelligence (AI) both to guide the sampling and to extract the relevant mechanistic information. We combine advanced sampling schemes with statistical inference, artificial neural networks, and deep learning to discover molecular mechanisms from MD simulations. Our framework adaptively and autonomously initializes simulations and learns the sampled mechanism, and is thus suitable for massively parallel computing architectures. We propose practical solutions to make the neural networks interpretable, as illustrated in applications to molecular systems.},

The presence of kinetic bottlenecks in such surfaces often renders a direct approach useless. A popular strategy is to identify a small number of key collective variables and to introduce a bias potential that is able to favor their fluctuations in order to accelerate sampling. Here, we propose to use machine-learning techniques in conjunction with the recent variationally enhanced sampling method [O. Valsson, M. Parrinello,
              Phys. Rev. Lett.
              113, 090601 (2014)] in order to determine such potential. This is achieved by expressing the bias as a neural network. The parameters are determined in a variational learning scheme aimed at minimizing an appropriate functional. This required the development of a more efficient minimization technique. The expressivity of neural networks allows representing rapidly varying free-energy surfaces, removes boundary effects artifacts, and allows several collective variables to be handled.},

In this paper, we characterize the performance of executing many tasks using RP when interfaced with JSM and PRRTE on Summit: RP is responsible for resource management and task scheduling on acquired resource; JSM or PRRTE enact the placement of launching of scheduled tasks. Our experiments provide lower bounds on the performance of RP when integrated with JSM and PRRTE. Specifically, for workloads comprised of homogeneous single-core, 15 minutes-long tasks we find that: PRRTE scales better than JSM for {$>$} O(1000) tasks; PRRTE overheads are negligible; and PRRTE supports optimizations that lower the impact of overheads and enable resource utilization of 63\% when executing O(16K), 1-core tasks over 404 compute nodes.},
